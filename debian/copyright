 srtmtiles.dat is generated by GenerateTileLookup.java, in the same
 directory, from the data available in the tiles*.txt files. This data
 is gathered from directory listings of a US government website, so it's
 PD.
 The website states:
   Most U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) information resides in the public domain
   and may be used without restriction. There is no legal requirement for users
   to acknowledge or credit USGS as the source for public domain information,
   but they may wish to do so as a courtesy.
 The tiles*.txt files can be re-generated with the debian/scripts/get-tiles.py
 script.
